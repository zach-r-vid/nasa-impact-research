# nasa-impact-research
Fracture analysis using CT scans, SEM imaging, and high-speed video of micro particle impacts from a NASA-aligned research project. Inludes 3D reconstruction and Python data processing scripts. 

This repository contains work from a research project conducted in collaboration with NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The study focuses on how high-speed impacts from microscopic sand and glass particles affect optical substrates. The work blends Python scripting, 3D reconstruction, high-speed video analysis, and microscopy data processing.
